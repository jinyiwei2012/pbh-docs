# Subscription Rules

One of the important modules of PeerBanHelper, it subscribes to rules from [PBH-BTN/BTN-Collected-Rules](https://github.com/PBH-BTN/BTN-Collected-Rules) by default.  
When an IP from the rules connects to the downloader, PeerBanHelper will immediately block it.

:::tip
It is not recommended to configure this feature through the configuration file; you can directly use the visual editor in the WebUI.

## Scope

PBH only checks torrents in an [active transfer state](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/WebUI-API-(qBittorrent-4.1)#torrent-management). Peers on `stalledUP` (seeding, no transfer) or paused torrents **will not be checked**.

This is a performance optimization. See [FAQ](../faq.md#why-are-some-connected-peers-not-being-banned-despite-configured-rules).

By default, the rule subscription module updates all subscription rules every time PeerBanHelper starts or every 4 hours. You can click the gear icon to change the update frequency of the subscription rules.

If you need to check the changes in the rules or whether the update was successful, you can click the "View History" button to view the update history.

## Creating Rules

PeerBanHelper can load an IP rule set composed of the following:

* IP addresses (supports v4 and v6), e.g., 1.2.3.4
* CIDR, e.g., 1.2.3.0/24
* Single-line comments starting with `#` (line-end comments are not supported)
